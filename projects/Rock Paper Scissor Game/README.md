    - Modify the number of rounds in the `scripts.js` file by adjusting the `moves` limit.

    ```javascript
    if (moves == 10) { 
        gameOver(playerOptions, movesLeft);
    }
    ```
    Change `10` to any other number for more or fewer rounds.

2. **Update the UI styles:**
    - Edit the styles in the `styles.css` file to change the look and feel of the game.

    For example, to change the background color, modify the `body` style:

    ```css
    body {
        background: linear-gradient(135deg, #d4ff00cf, #9e7f01cc);
    }
    ```

3. **Modify the result messages:**
    - Update the result text in the `scripts.js` file inside the `winner` and `gameOver` functions to personalize the game messages.
