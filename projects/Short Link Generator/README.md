## Technologies

- **HTML**: Structure and content of the application.
- **CSS**: Styling for the layout, dark mode, and animations.
- **JavaScript**: Functionality for generating short links, toggling themes, and clock updates.
- **Rebrandly API**: Used to generate short links.
- **Bootstrap**: For responsive design and additional UI components.

## How It Works

1. **Short Link Generation**:
   - User inputs a URL.
   - JavaScript validates the URL format.
   - If valid, an AJAX request is sent to the Rebrandly API.
   - The API response provides the short URL, which is displayed to the user.
   
2. **Dark Mode**:
   - The page dynamically switches between light and dark themes using CSS variable overrides.
   - User preferences persist while toggling themes.

3. **Analog Clock**:
   - The clock uses CSS animations for a smooth ticking effect.
   - It updates automatically in sync with the current time.

## Customization

### API Key
- Replace the `apikey` in the `script.js` file with your own Rebrandly API key:
    ```javascript
    const requestHeaders = {
        "Content-Type": "application/json",
        "apikey": "YOUR_API_KEY",
    };
    ```

### Styling
- Update `style.css` to customize colors, fonts, or animations. Examples:
    - Change button hover effect:
        ```css
        .wrap_btn:hover {
            transform: scale(1.15);
        }
        ```

### Analog Clock
- Modify clock styles in `style.css` for a different look:
    ```css
    .clock-hand {
        background-color: var(--accent-color);
    }
    ```
