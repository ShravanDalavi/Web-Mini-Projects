- File: `login.html`

## Technologies
- HTML5: Structuring content.
- CSS3: Styling and responsive design.
- JavaScript: Dynamic interactions and local storage.
- Local Storage: Data persistence for blogs.

## How It Works
1. Blog Storage:
- Blogs are stored in the browser's `localStorage`.
- Example structure:
```json
[
  {
    "title": "Sample Blog",
    "content": "This is a sample blog post.",
    "isPublished": true,
    "date": "2025-01-01, 10:00 AM"
  }
]
```
2. Admin Panel:
- Login credentials are verified through hardcoded values.
- Upon successful login, the user is redirected to the editor.html page.

3. Dynamic Updates:
- Blog content is dynamically rendered on the homepage and editor.
- Published blogs are sorted by date and displayed with custom styles.

## Customization
1. Styling:
- Modify the CSS variables in `css/styles.css` to change the color scheme, font, or layout.
2. Admin Credentials:
- Update the login credentials in the JavaScript file (`js/app.js`)
```JavaScript
if (username === 'your-username' && password === 'your-password') { ... }
```
3. Blog Content:
- Blogs are fetched and manipulated through JavaScript. You can extend the functionality by integrating a backend or database.
